The Automatic Aquatic pH Regulation System project aims to design and implement a system for monitoring and regulating pH levels in aquatic environments. Utilizing an Arduino Uno, a pH sensor, and a motor driver IC, the system automatically adjusts pH levels to maintain optimal conditions for aquatic organisms. pH is maintained between 6.5 to 9 inwhich if pH goes below 6.5, the motordriver ic activates the submersible pump and discharges the liquid to increases the pH.if pH goes ABOVE 9, the motordriver ic activates the submersible pump and discharges the liquid to decreases the pH.
